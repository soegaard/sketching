 * @arialabel Red circle grows larger and turns more yellow as the user’s mouse moves right on the screen and does the opposite as the user’s mouse moves left
 * @description Use the map() function to take any number and scale it to a
 * new number that is more useful for the project that you are working on.
 * For example, use the numbers from the mouse position to control the size or color of a shape.
 * In this example, the mouse’s x-coordinate (numbers between 0 and 360) are scaled to new numbers
 * to define the color and size of a circle.
