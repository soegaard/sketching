Sketching is a language/library for creative coding. The focus is to make graphical programs accessible for beginners, artists, educators and designers. Sketching is free to use and the source is available to read and improve.

The main focus of Sketching is graphical programs. Running a program will display a canvas ready to show static images or animation.

The inspiration for Sketching came from the Processing project. Processing is a programming language built on top of Java. The Processing language was devised by Ben Fry and Casey Reas.

Think of Sketching as what Processing would have looked like, if it used Racket as its programming language instead of Java. Alternatively, think of Sketching as Racket with an easy to use graphics library.

Although inspired by the Processing project, this project has no affiliation with the Processing Foundation.
